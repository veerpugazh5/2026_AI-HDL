## üöÄ Welcome to AI-HDL 2025-2026!

The **AI Hardware Design League (AI-HDL)** is an innovative educational competition that combines the power of **Artificial Intelligence** with **Hardware Design**. Students from around the world collaborate in teams to design cutting-edge hardware using Large Language Models (LLMs) and modern EDA tools.

> **No prior hardware design experience required!** üéØ

**üéì Inspired by**: The pioneering work of the [University of Arizona AI-HDL program](https://csm.arizona.edu/AIHDL), which has successfully demonstrated the power of AI-assisted hardware design education with winners like "AI or Die" from University of Arizona and international teams from Vietnam, Germany, and India.

## Understand the challenge

- In this competition, your team will be given a specific hardware design problem to solve. The challenge is to develop an HDL solution with the help of AI. This means you‚Äôll use AI tools (such as ChatGPT or other code-generating models) to write and improve your Verilog/VHDL code. You might prompt the AI to generate a module, debug errors, or suggest optimizations. Part of the challenge is learning how to ask the right questions and refine AI outputs to get correct, efficient hardware designs.
- The project will be structured in phases with milestones. You will start with an initial design phase, then iteratively refine your hardware based on performance and security requirements. At each milestone, you‚Äôll verify your design against the provided test benches to ensure correctness. Mentors will conduct design reviews, giving feedback and guidance. Expect to learn about hardware fundamentals, simulation tools, and best practices in chip design along the way. By the final phase, your team should have a fully working design meeting the challenge specifications.
- **What to expect:** It‚Äôs a hands-on learning experience. You‚Äôll attend workshops/webinars (see Workshop & Resources below) on topics like using AI in hardware design, how to run simulations, and more. You‚Äôll also document your progress, keeping track of your AI prompts, design decisions, and test results. In the end, teams will present their designs, share their approach, and demonstrate how AI contributed. This challenge is not just about getting a working chip design, but also about exploring creative AI-driven solutions and learning from the process. Embrace the experimentation, and enjoy the ride!

### **Frequently asked Questions**

- AI-HDL - [FAQ](https://csm.arizona.edu/AIHDL#faq)

---

## Open Source Requirements

- This challenge is founded on open-source principles. All work produced as part of AI-HDL should be made openly available so that others can learn from and build upon it. Each team‚Äôs project repository (including code, documentation, and any data) must be shared under an open-source license.

### Key expectations:

- **Open Code Repository:** Teams will use a source control platform (e.g., GitHub) to host their project. While the competition is running, you may use a private repository (with access given to judges and mentors). However, by the end of the competition, the repository should be made public (unless the organizers specify a different timeline) to showcase the work and allow knowledge sharing.
- **Attribution and Originality:** If your team uses any third-party open-source components or code snippets, that‚Äôs fine just make sure to credit them and comply with their licenses. Your own work should be original. Plagiarism or using proprietary code is against the spirit of the challenge. By sticking to open-source resources and licensing your own project properly, you contribute to a culture of transparency and innovation.
- Following open-source practices isn‚Äôt just a rule; it‚Äôs part of the learning experience. You‚Äôll get familiar with tools like Git, learn how to document a project for public consumption, and understand licensing ‚Äì all valuable professional skills. We believe sharing your work openly benefits the whole community and accelerates progress in AI-driven hardware design.
